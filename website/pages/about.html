      <h3>MyPass</h3>
      <p>A simple app to share secrets</p></div>

<div class="about-header" id="about-header">
  <h4>MyPass allows users to share secrets in a secure and ephemeral way</h4>
  <p>Sharing one-time URLs is much safer than sending your sensitive data in emails, texts or instant message</p>
  <p>Secrets are always encrypted and decryption keys are never stored on MyPass</p>
  <p>Data stored on MyPass should be considered ephemeral at all times</p>
  <br>
  <h4>How do I use MyPass?</h4>
  <p>Input your secret, select the expiration of the secert and click "Generate" to create a one-time use URL for secret retrieval</p>
  <p>Share this URL with your intended recipient</p>
  <p>Secrets are immediately purged upon retrieval or expiration, whichever happens first</p>
  <br>
  <h4>Who can retrieve my secret?</h4>
  <p>Anyone within posession of the URL can retrieve your secret. First come first serve</p>
  <br>
  <h4>Is there any way to retrieve the secret apart from the URL?</h4>
  <p>Decrypting secrets outside of the one-time URL process is not possible</p>
  <p>Keys are contained only within the URL and stored no where else</p>
